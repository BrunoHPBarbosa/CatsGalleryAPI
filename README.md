Hello everyone!

That is a codeChallenge that some companies usually present at interviews.

It's about creating a single screen, with the aim of using the IMGUR api, and making a request to bring up cat images.



To make the call correctly, use a Client Id in the request header and a QUERY parameter to return “cats” as a response.



I used Postman to make the calls and see how the request is set up.



I think that in this test, what turns a lot of people off is the fact that the api response brings up a lot of information, and the test is clear and objective, only asking for cat images, however, the same response brings up images and videos, using the same response field, then the checks and “filters” come into play, to display only the item that is image/png, 


and so we have the cutest result on your screen
